Contact me on X or if your balls/brains are just out-of-control optimized for life, create a free account on https://joywrite.ai/motivated-pilot-application and click that link until you get to the secret fully-refundable deposit page to book time with me. $how me you're serious, and I'll show you what's possible. I am NOT working directly with companies outside the top 3-4 in their market, ideally another #1 or two who I can just lock-in with and secure another 20 years reign soaking up the lion's share of your TAM with. 

Lmao FUNDING.yml, complete. For now. ðŸ¤£
